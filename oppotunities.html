                                    sources. They are a niche hardware player in the field of electric charging. 
                                    The big idea behind AmperaPark is that they will become a “smart charging system”. 
                                    This means that energy is used in a more balanced way than today, 
                                    all based on the needs of the car owner. Their challenge: “How can we develop 
                                    a payment and reservation app that offers security and commitment for 
                                    the end user of the smart parking space?
